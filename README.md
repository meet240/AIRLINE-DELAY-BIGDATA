This project aims to analyze airline delay data using various Big Data technologies such as PySpark, Hive, and Sqoop. The project is divided into several components, each contributing to the overall analysis. Below is a summary of each component and its purpose:

Files Overview
1. airline_ml.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook contains the machine learning aspect of the project. The key steps include:

Data Loading and Exploration: Loading the dataset and exploring the structure and features.
Data Transformation: Handling missing values, splitting timestamps, and feature engineering.
Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features and assigning labels based on departure delays.
Model Training: Using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to predict departure delays.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
2. hive.hql
This Hive script is used to create an external table named airline in Amazon RDS for exporting incremental data to S3. It defines the table schema and structure for storing airline-related data.

3. sqoop.txt
This text file contains Sqoop commands for importing and exporting data between Amazon RDS and S3. Key operations include exporting full and incremental data to RDS and importing data from RDS to Hadoop HDFS and Hive.

4. pythonscript.py
This Python script utilizes PySpark for data cleaning, transformation, and processing. It covers tasks such as dropping unwanted columns, handling null values, cleaning data formats, and converting data types. Additionally, it demonstrates the process of storing data in Parquet format in S3 and handling incremental data.

Usage Instructions
Jupyter Notebook (airline_ml.ipynb):

Open the Jupyter Notebook using a Python environment with necessary libraries (e.g., PySpark, scikit-learn).
Execute the cells sequentially to load, preprocess, and train machine learning models.
Hive Script (hive.hql):

Execute the Hive script in a Hive environment to create the external table airline in Amazon RDS.
Sqoop Commands (sqoop.txt):

Run the Sqoop commands in a terminal to perform data import/export operations between RDS and Hadoop.
Python Script (pythonscript.py):

Ensure you have a PySpark environment set up.
Replace placeholder values and execute the script to clean, transform, and store data in Parquet format.
Note
Adjust file paths and configurations based on your environment.
Ensure proper access and permissions for data sources and destinations.
Monitor and adapt the scripts for any changes in the dataset or technology stack.
